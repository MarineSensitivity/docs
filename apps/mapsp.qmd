## Overview

The **mapsp** application ([shiny.marinesensitivity.org/mapsp](https://shiny.marinesensitivity.org/mapsp/)) enables exploration of individual species distribution models within the MST database. Users can view merged and source-level models, compare masked vs. unmasked distributions, and access detailed species regulatory status information.

@fig-mapsp-blue-whale shows the merged distribution model for the blue whale (*Balaenoptera musculus*). The map displays cell values from 1 (low suitability, blue) to 100 (high suitability, red) across all US program areas where the species occurs.

## Features

### Species Selection

- **Search**: find species by common name or scientific name
- **Category filter**: narrow results by species category (bird, coral, fish, invertebrate, mammal, reptile/turtle)
- **Alphabetical browsing**: scroll through species lists within each category

### Model Display

- **Merged model**: the final merged distribution showing MAX values across all source datasets, with masking and spatial floors applied
- **Source datasets**: toggle individual source layers (AquaMaps, NMFS CH, FWS CH, FWS Range, BirdLife, IUCN Range) to see each dataset's contribution
- **IUCN masking toggle**: compare the unmasked AquaMaps SDM with the masked merged model to visualize the effect of range constraints

### Species Info Panel

Detailed information for the selected species:

- Scientific name and common name
- Species category (bird, fish, mammal, etc.)
- ESA listing status (Endangered, Threatened, or not listed)
- IUCN Red List category
- MMPA protection flag
- MBTA protection flag
- Computed extinction risk score (1--100)
- Number of source datasets contributing to the merged model

### Deep-Linking

The application supports URL parameters for direct linking to specific species, enabling bookmarking and sharing of specific views:

```

```

## Generating Screenshots

```{r}
#| label: mapsp-webshot
#| eval: false

# capture screenshot (requires app running at URL)
webshot2::webshot(
  url     = "https://shiny.marinesensitivity.org/mapsp/",
  file    = here::here("docs/figures/apps/mapsp-blue-whale.png"),
  delay   = 5,
  vwidth  = 1200,
  vheight = 800)
