    "text": "1.1 Overview\nThe Marine Sensitivity Toolkit (MST) is a cloud-native system developed for BOEM (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management) to assess the sensitivity of marine species to offshore energy development, whether oil & gas or wind. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), Section 18(a)(2)(G), mandates that BOEM consider “the relative environmental sensitivity and marine productivity of different areas of the OCS” when planning the timing and location of offshore energy activities. The MST operationalizes this mandate by combining the best available species distribution data with extinction risk assessments to map areas of the ocean that are most sensitive to human activities.\nThe MST marks a significant advancement over prior RESA methodologies (Morandi et al. 2018). Earlier approaches often relied on aggregated data from a limited set of broad species groups and surrogate species, lacking spatially explicit information for individual organisms. As a result, previous assessments were typically coarse and areawide, frequently missing critical ecological variation and fine-scale patterns across the OCS. In contrast, the MST uses a high-resolution 0.05° grid (~4 km per cell) on a species level to capture fine-scale conservation concerns and ecological patterns across US waters.\nThe current system integrates 9,819 valid marine species across 7 source datasets, mapped at 0.05° resolution (~4 km cells) across 20 BOEM Program Areas spanning US waters. Species distributions are weighted by extinction risk scores that incorporate protections under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), and Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), as well as IUCN Red List assessments. The merged distribution of sensitivity per species is masked to expert ranges where available, so suitable habitat is not included outside known ranges.\nThis is a process, not a product. Information is imperfect, especially given the large expanse of US waters. Distributions and abundance of species change, modified increasingly by climate change and human activities. Knowledge on species sensitivities continues to expand with more research. Methods for both modeling and distributing this information continue to improve. In alignment with Executive Order 14303, we aim to provide a transparent and reproducible process that can be regularly updated as new data and methods become available.\nThe MST analytical pipeline proceeds through the following stages (Figure 1.1):\nFigure 1.1: Flowchart of the MST analytical pipeline: from source datasets and taxonomic matching through model merging, scoring, and visualization.\nFigure 1.2 illustrates the full methodology at a glance. On the left, species distribution data flows in from 7 source datasets and 5 taxonomic authorities. In the center, models are merged per species and weighted by extinction risk scores derived from ESA, MMPA, MBTA, and IUCN regulatory frameworks. On the right, cell-level scores are rescaled within BOEM ecoregions and aggregated to program areas for visualization in the interactive mapping applications.",

    "text": "2.1 Conceptual Framework\nThe term combination of exposure and sensitivityvulnerability (\\(V\\)) is a function of the magnitude of the change in the environmentexposure (\\(E\\)), the magnitude of response to the changesensitivity (\\(S\\)) and the capacity of the ecosystem or organism to improve and reorganise in response to stress such as climate change through phenotypic plasticity (acclimation, acclimatisation) or adaptation, distributional shifts, and rapid evolution of traits suited to new conditions. Source: @ross2023.adaptive capacity (\\(A\\)) (Equation 2.1).\n\\[\nV = f(E, S, A)\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nThe more exposed and sensitive an area is—and the less able it is to recover—the more vulnerable it is to impacts from offshore human activities. The MST currently focuses on the sensitivity component, quantifying the intrinsic biological sensitivity of marine ecosystems based on the species present and their conservation status. Exposure and adaptive capacity components are planned for future phases (see Chapter 8).",

To enable meaningful cross-region comparison, scores are rescaled to a [0–100%] range within each BOEM ecoregion (Equation 2.3):\n\\[\nv'_c = \\frac{v_c - v_{min}}{v_{max} - v_{min}} \\times 100\n\\tag{2.3}\\]\nwhere \\(v_{min}\\) and \\(v_{max}\\) are the minimum and maximum cell scores within the ecoregion. This accounts for the natural gradient from species-rich tropical waters to less diverse polar regions, ensuring that a “high sensitivity” score has consistent meaning across all program areas.\nEcoregional rescaling makes it easy to compare areas within the same region, and Program Area aggregation gives an overall sensitivity score for each area, considering both the sensitivity of each part and how big each part is.\nSee subsequent chapters for detailed descriptions of: data sources (Chapter 3), taxonomic integration (Chapter 4), extinction risk scoring (Chapter 5), model merging (Chapter 6), and scoring methodology (Chapter 7).",

This ensures that the legal protection afforded to marine mammals is reflected in the sensitivity analysis.\nThe MMPA floor is intentionally higher than the MBTA floor because the MMPA imposes a stronger statutory standard: it affirmatively requires that all marine mammal populations be maintained at Optimum Sustainable Population levels and mandates active population recovery, whereas the MBTA is primarily a prohibitive take statute. Marine mammals also tend to have lower reproductive rates and longer recovery times than most seabirds, making them intrinsically more sensitive to disturbance.\n\n\n5.1.3 Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA)\nThe Migratory Bird Treaty Act (1918) protects migratory birds, which includes most seabird species. Similar to MMPA, all migratory birds receive a minimum spatial floor score of 10 in cells where they are present.\n\n\n5.1.4 IUCN Red List\nThe IUCN Red List of Threatened Species provides internationally recognized conservation status assessments used for species not listed under US federal laws:\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: IUCN Red List categories used in extinction risk scoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nAbbreviation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCritically Endangered\nCR\nextremely high risk of extinction in the wild\n\n\nEndangered\nEN\nvery high risk of extinction in the wild\n\n\nVulnerable\nVU\nhigh risk of extinction in the wild\n\n\nNear Threatened\nNT\nclose to qualifying for a threatened category\n\n\nLeast Concern\nLC\nwidespread and abundant\n\n\nData Deficient\nDD\ninadequate information to assess",

For example, if AquaMaps predicts 30% suitability but NMFS has designated the cell as critical habitat for an endangered species (100%), the merged value is 100%.\n\n\n6.1.3 Step 3: Spatial Masking\nWhen an IUCN range map, NMFS Critical Habitat, or FWS Critical Habitat exists for a species, the merged model is constrained to the spatial extent of these mask datasets. The mask is formed as the union of all available is_mask = TRUE datasets for that species.\nThis prevents the AquaMaps SDM (which often has broad environmental envelope predictions) from extending species presence far beyond their known range.

    "text": "The Marine Sensitivity Toolkit (MST) is a stack of software components for reproducibly, interactively and hierarchically generating environmental vulnerability maps and scores. Tabular data is collated across studies evaluating sensitivity of species to oil & gas and offshore wind energy development. The best available species and benthic habitat distributions are being mosaicked across the US EEZ. Scores will be summarized according to subgroups within Species, Benthic Habitats and Primary Productivity. These scores will be averaged into an overall score and visualized as a flower plot, applicable to various levels of BOEM relevancy: regional, ecoregions, protraction diagrams, blocks and aliquots. The software components for achieving this interactively are: 1) server — a Docker configuration to spin up all the software; 2) database — a spatially enabled database (PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension); 3) workflows — scripts (as Quarto notebooks) to explore, ingest and update the database and output files; 4) APIs — application programming interfaces for rendering vector (using pg_tileserv) or raster (using TiTiler) tile services for interactive mapping as well as a custom API (using R plumber); 5) libraries — re-usable documented functions as an R package for import, analysis and visualization using the APIs; 6) applications — interactive apps using the R Shiny framework for rendering vulnerability maps; and 7) documentation — as a Quarto notebook with figures, tables, glossary and references in interactive html or static docx/pdf output formats. This toolbox is intended to primarily serve BOEM needs internally, but by being open-source and fully reproducible the hope is to enlist buy-in and even contributions from external partners, whether from other government agencies, academia, NGOs or industry.\nWe ascribe to the philosophy of sharing all code for the sake of reproducibility, transparency and efficiency (Maitner et al. 2024; Lowndes et al. 2017); i.e. the FAIR principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (Wilkinson et al. 2016).\n\n9.0.1 Interactive Applications\nWe have developed a series of interactive applications to explore the data and results of the MST project. These applications allow users to visualize the data, explore the results, and interact with the data in a more intuitive way. The applications are built using the shiny package in R (Chang et al. 2024), which allows us to easily create a user interface with complex reactivity for an interactive web application easily accessed through a web browser. The applications are designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with interactive maps, charts, and tables that allow users to explore the data in a more dynamic way.\n\n\n9.0.2 Overcoming Challenges with Large Spatial Data\nThe MS project incorporates many large spatial datasets that are problematic to render in a typical interactive application. For instance, the most common interactive mapping R package leaflet has a 4MB limitation for displaying rasters (see “Large Raster Warning” in Raster Images • leaflet). Vectors (i.e., points, lines and polygons) get smoothed when containing many vertices, but contiguity gets lost between polygons and rendering degrades to non-usable depending on the internet speed of the user’s connection.\nTo work around these limitations, we have implemented “cloud native” web services and formats (see also Cloud-Optimized Geospatial Formats Guide). Our implementations effectively reduce the size of any given spatial object based on the zoom level of the user’s browser. For rasters, we use cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) and for vectors, we use Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT). These formats are designed to be fast and efficient for web mapping applications, and they allow us to display large spatial datasets in an interactive web application without sacrificing performance or usability. Let’s take a closer look at implementation of each.\n\n9.0.2.1 Raster: Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) and Titiler\nHistorically, to read a raster, such as a GeoTIFF, from the web, the client software would have to read the entire file before rendering. Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) take advantage of HTTP GET range requests to read only the part of the file needed for rendering. So a COG stores quadtree simplifications of the original raster at multiple zoom levels and metadata for accessing their byte ranges in the file in the metadata header. This allows the client software to request only the parts of the file needed for rendering, which can greatly reduce the amount of data transferred and speed up rendering. This is for accessing the raw data in pixel values, e.g., for a raster of species distribution then the abundance of a species in each cell. We would want to also apply a color ramp to visualize the data. The open-source (TiTiler software is a lightweight web service that serves up these color ramped tiles on the fly. So COGs can be stored on a simple file server (like Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage) and served up as interactive web maps with TiTiler as an intermediary between the COG files and the client accessing the interactive Shiny mapping app (Figure 9.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Sequence diagram implementing large raster interactive display using Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) and Titiler in a Shiny mapping app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.0.2.2 Vector: Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVTs) and pg_tileserv\nAlthough “cloud native” vector formats exist for simple file storage (see Cloud-Optimized Geospatial Formats Guide), none of these allow for flexible filtering and manipulation. Instead, we use PostgreSQL with the spatial extension (PostGIS) to store the vector data and serve it as Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVTs) using the pg_tileserv web service written in the language Go, which is very fast. This means that we don’t have to pre-render the MVTs (such as you might do with tippecanoe), but can instead serve the raw vector data directly from the database and let pg_tileserv handle the rendering on the fly. Filters (in the form of CQL) can be applied to the request. Symbology is rendered client-side via JavaScript, which allows for interactive hover and click events on vector objects (e.g., BOEM aliquot). Some speed-up is enabled by implementing a Varnish cache service in between. We can even write our own database functions for customized rendering, such as H3 hexagonal summaries. This allows us to serve vector data as web maps with minimal configuration and setup, and it provides a fast and efficient way to display large vector datasets in an interactive web application (Figure 9.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Sequence diagram implementing large vector interactive display using Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVTs) and pg_tileserv in a Shiny mapping app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.0.3 Github Repositories\n\n\n\n\n\nrepo\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n.github\norganization README\n\n\napi\napplication programming interface (API) using R Plumber package\n\n\napps\nShiny applications\n\n\ndocs\ndocumentation for BOEM’s offshore environmental sensitivity index products\n\n\nmanuscripts\nManuscripts with review of sensitivities by industry and receptors (species, habitats, human uses)\n\n\nMarineSensitivity.github.io\ndefault website\n\n\nmsens\nR library of functions for mapping marine sensitivities, sponsored by BOEM\n\n\nobjectives\nrepository for issues spanning multiple repositories and doing big picture roadmapping\n\n\nserver\nserver setup for R Shiny apps, RStudio IDE, R Plumber API, PostGIS database, pg_tileserv\n\n\nworkflows\nscripts for testing data analytics and visualization as well as production workflows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.0.4 Software Components\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPIs\n\n\napplication programming interfaces (APIs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApps\n\n\ninteractive applications using Shiny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase\n\n\nPostgreSQL database extended spatially with PostGIS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocs\n\n\ntechnical documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibraries\n\n\ndocumented functions as an R package\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer\n\n\nserver software configuration using Docker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkflows\n\n\nscripts for exploring plus production workflows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChang, Winston, Joe Cheng, JJ Allaire, Carson Sievert, Barret Schloerke, Yihui Xie, Jeff Allen, Jonathan McPherson, Alan Dipert, and Barbara Borges. 2024. “Shiny: Web Application Framework for r.” https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny.\n\n\nLowndes, Julia S.
