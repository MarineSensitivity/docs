    "text": "This Marine Sensitivity (MS) project of BOEM seeks to assess the sensitivity of marine species to offshore energy development, whether oil & gas or wind. By combining the best available species distributions with known species sensitivities we can map out areas of the ocean that are most vulnerable to human activities. This information can be used to inform decisions about where to place energy infrastructure and/or implement mitigations to minimize impacts on the marine environment.\nThis is a process, not a product. Information is imperfect, especially given the large expanse of US waters. Distributions and abundance of species change, modified increasingly by climate change and human activities. Knowledge on species sensitivities continues to expand with more research. And finally the methods for both modeling and distributing all this information continue to improve. We aim to provide a transparent and reproducible process that can be regularly updated as new data and methods become available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n\n  %% nodes\n  ta[(\"&lt;a href='https://docs.ropensci.org/taxize/articles/datasources.html'&gt;taxonomic&lt;br&gt;authority&lt;/a&gt;\")]:::in\n  sd(\"species&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;distributions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(vector|raster)\"):::in\n  sdm(\"species&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;distributions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(+taxaid)\"):::out\n  sdmt(\"species&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;distributions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(aligned rasters)\"):::out\n  sdmte(\"species&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;vulnerability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;raster\"):::out\n  ct(\"&lt;b&gt;topology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;to share&lt;br&gt;\"):::in\n  st[[\"species&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;sensitivities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(tables)\"]]:::in\n  stm[[\"species&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;sensitivities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(+ taxaid)\"]]:::out\n  stmc[[\"species&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;sensitivities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(equation ready)\"]]:::out\n  eq[[\"&lt;b&gt;equation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;of sensitivities per species\"]]:::in\n  m[/\"&lt;b&gt;match&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;taxa\"/]:::fxn\n  t[/\"&lt;b&gt;transform&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;to rasters\"/]:::fxn\n  c[/\"&lt;b&gt;clean&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;tables\"/]:::fxn\n  e[/\"&lt;b&gt;evaluate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;rescale(&sum;eq&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;)\"/]:::fxn\n\n  %% edges\n  ta   --&gt; m\n  sd   --&gt; m\n  st   --&gt; m\n  m    --&gt; sdm\n  m    --&gt; stm\n  sdm  --&gt; t\n  ct   --&gt; t\n  t    --&gt; sdmt\n  stm  --&gt; c\n  c    --&gt; stmc\n  eq   --&gt; e\n  sdmt --&gt; e\n  stmc --&gt; e\n  e    --&gt; sdmte\n\n  %% Legend\n  in(input):::in\n  fxn[/process/]:::fxn\n  out(output):::out\n  subgraph Legend\n    in\n    fxn\n    out\n  end\n\n  %% styles\n  classDef in  fill:lightblue\n  classDef out fill:lightgreen\n  classDef fxn fill:yellow\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Flowchart of process for incorporating marine species sensitivities with distributions and generating a holistic vulnerability map.",

I explained that a higher sensitivity score indicates an area that could be susceptible to minor perturbations, while a lower score suggests an area that is more robust to minor changes.” - TW\n\nOHI\nIn the original Ocean Health Index (Halpern et al. 2012), the length of the petal reflected the percent towards maximum sustainability of the given goal. The framework is also based on a reference point, either spatially or temporally (Samhouri et al. 2012).\n\nRESA ’25\nIt makes sense to make the most vulnerable the highest score, so a low score is preferable (versus a preferred high score for sustainability of an OHI goal). We’ll need to determine what the “highest” score means as a reference point and consider SMART criteria. (Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, Time-related). Will the reference point be the same globally or vary based on some regional maximum?\n\nPetal Width (and possiblyvarying weights)\n“Another question was about how we manage the weights. I mentioned that we are not currently applying weights, but someone seemed concerned about it. We can discuss this further if needed.” - TW\n\nOHI\nFor the OHI flower plot, the width of the petal represents its weight contributing to the weighted average score in the center of the flower. The varying importance of each goal is based on societally held values with potentially different value sets, such as preservationist vs extractive:\n\nRESA ’25\nFor the RESA ’25, when looking at Species, Habitats and Primary Productivity, how shall they be weighted to factor into a final score? Shall species groups be simply weighted based on the number of species within, total biomass, extinction risk, commercial value, etc? And then Species versus less numerous Benthic Habitats and a singular value for Primary Productivity? I will conduct a literature survey to assign sensible value sets, but an App could also apply a user-defined value set to assign weights. That gets messy, but if transparent and easy ideally would lead to scientific consensus with a workshop and/or survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalpern, Benjamin S., Catherine Longo, Darren Hardy, Karen L.

    "text": "The Marine Sensitivity Toolkit (MST) is a stack of software components for reproducibly, interactively and hierarchically generating environmental vulnerability maps and scores. Tabular data is collated across studies evaluating sensitivity of species to oil & gas and offshore wind energy development. The best available species and benthic habitat distributions are being mosaicked across the US EEZ. Scores will be summarized according to subgroups within Species, Benthic Habitats and Primary Productivity. These scores will be averaged into an overall score and visualized as a flower plot, applicable to various levels of BOEM relevancy: regional, ecoregions, protraction diagrams, blocks and aliquots. The software components for achieving this interactively are: 1) server — a Docker configuration to spin up all the software; 2) database — a spatially enabled database (PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension); 3) workflows — scripts (as Quarto notebooks) to explore, ingest and update the database and output files; 4) APIs — application programming interfaces for rendering vector (using pg_tileserv) or raster (using TiTiler) tile services for interactive mapping as well as a custom API (using R plumber); 5) libraries — re-usable documented functions as an R package for import, analysis and visualization using the APIs; 6) applications — interactive apps using the R Shiny framework for rendering vulnerability maps; and 7) documentation — as a Quarto notebook with figures, tables, glossary and references in interactive html or static docx/pdf output formats. This toolbox is intended to primarily serve BOEM needs internally, but by being open-source and fully reproducible the hope is to enlist buy-in and even contributions from external partners, whether from other government agencies, academia, NGOs or industry.\nWe ascribe to the philosophy of sharing all code for the sake of reproducibility, transparency and efficiency (Maitner et al. 2024; Lowndes et al. 2017); i.e. the FAIR principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (Wilkinson et al. 2016).\n\n7.0.1 Interactive Applications\nWe have developed a series of interactive applications to explore the data and results of the MST project. These applications allow users to visualize the data, explore the results, and interact with the data in a more intuitive way. The applications are built using the shiny package in R (Chang et al. 2024), which allows us to easily create a user interface with complex reactivity for an interactive web application easily accessed through a web browser. The applications are designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with interactive maps, charts, and tables that allow users to explore the data in a more dynamic way.\n\n\n7.0.2 Overcoming Challenges with Large Spatial Data\nThe MS project incorporates many large spatial datasets that are problematic to render in a typical interactive application. For instance, the most common interactive mapping R package leaflet has a 4MB limitation for displaying rasters (see “Large Raster Warning” in Raster Images • leaflet). Vectors (i.e., points, lines and polygons) get smoothed when containing many vertices, but contiguity gets lost between polygons and rendering degrades to non-usable depending on the internet speed of the user’s connection.\nTo work around these limitations, we have implemented “cloud native” web services and formats (see also Cloud-Optimized Geospatial Formats Guide). Our implementations effectively reduce the size of any given spatial object based on the zoom level of the user’s browser. For rasters, we use cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) and for vectors, we use Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT). These formats are designed to be fast and efficient for web mapping applications, and they allow us to display large spatial datasets in an interactive web application without sacrificing performance or usability. Let’s take a closer look at implementation of each.\n\n7.0.2.1 Raster: Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) and Titiler\nHistorically, to read a raster, such as a GeoTIFF, from the web, the client software would have to read the entire file before rendering. Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) take advantage of HTTP GET range requests to read only the part of the file needed for rendering. So a COG stores quadtree simplifications of the original raster at multiple zoom levels and metadata for accessing their byte ranges in the file in the metadata header. This allows the client software to request only the parts of the file needed for rendering, which can greatly reduce the amount of data transferred and speed up rendering. This is for accessing the raw data in pixel values, e.g., for a raster of species distribution then the abundance of a species in each cell. We would want to also apply a color ramp to visualize the data. The open-source (TiTiler software is a lightweight web service that serves up these color ramped tiles on the fly. So COGs can be stored on a simple file server (like Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage) and served up as interactive web maps with TiTiler as an intermediary between the COG files and the client accessing the interactive Shiny mapping app (Figure 7.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  autonumber\n  Client      -&gt;&gt; ShinyServer: request Shiny map app with a raster layer\n  ShinyServer -&gt;&gt; Client:      return JavaScript (JS) with URL specification for raster tiles\n  loop for every tile in the current view (based on zoom level and bounding box)\n    Client     -&gt;&gt; TiTiler:    request specific raster tile ({z}/{x}/{y})\n    TiTiler    -&gt;&gt; FileServer: read metadata from COG file and request byte range for tile ({z}/{x}/{y})\n    FileServer -&gt;&gt; TiTiler:    send byte range for tile\n    TiTiler    -&gt;&gt; Client:     apply color ramp to tile and return PNG\n  end\n%% mmdc -i diagrams/raster.mmd --theme default --backgroundColor transparent --scale 8 -o diagrams/raster.png\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Sequence diagram implementing large raster interactive display using Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) and Titiler in a Shiny mapping app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.0.2.2 Vector: Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVTs) and pg_tileserv\nAlthough “cloud native” vector formats exist for simple file storage (see Cloud-Optimized Geospatial Formats Guide), none of these allow for flexible filtering and manipulation. Instead, we use PostgreSQL with the spatial extension (PostGIS) to store the vector data and serve it as Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVTs) using the pg_tileserv web service written in the language Go, which is very fast. This means that we don’t have to pre-render the MVTs (such as you might do with tippecanoe), but can instead serve the raw vector data directly from the database and let pg_tileserv handle the rendering on the fly. Filters (in the form of CQL) can be applied to the request. Symbology is rendered client-side via JavaScript, which allows for interactive hover and click events on vector objects (e.g., BOEM aliquot). Some speed-up is enabled by implementing a Varnish cache service in between. We can even write our own database functions for customized rendering, such as H3 hexagonal summaries. This allows us to serve vector data as web maps with minimal configuration and setup, and it provides a fast and efficient way to display large vector datasets in an interactive web application (Figure 7.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  autonumber\n  Client        -&gt;&gt; ShinyServer: request Shiny map app with a vector layer\n  ShinyServer   -&gt;&gt; Client: return JavaScript (JS) with URL specification for vector tiles\n  loop for every tile in the current view (based on zoom level and bounding box)\n    Client      -&gt;&gt; VarnishCache: request specific vector tile ({z}/{x}/{y})\n    alt cache hit\n      VarnishCache -&gt;&gt; Client: return vector tile\n    else cache miss\n      VarnishCache -&gt;&gt; pg_tileserv:  request specific vector tile ({z}/{x}/{y})\n      pg_tileserv  -&gt;&gt; pgDB:         run query to create vector tile in PostGIS database\n      pgDB         -&gt;&gt; pg_tileserv:  return vector tile in compressed Protobuf format (*.pbf)\n      pg_tileserv  -&gt;&gt; VarnishCache: store vector tile\n      VarnishCache -&gt;&gt; Client:       return vector tile\n    end\n  end\n%% mmdc -i diagrams/vector.mmd --theme default --backgroundColor transparent --scale 8 -o diagrams/vector.png\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Sequence diagram implementing large vector interactive display using Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVTs) and pg_tileserv in a Shiny mapping app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.0.3 Github Repositories\n\n\n\n\n\nrepo\ndescription\n\n\n\n\napi\napplication programming interface (API) using R Plumber package\n\n\napps\nShiny applications\n\n\ndocs\ndocumentation for BOEM’s offshore environmental sensitivity index products\n\n\nmanuscripts\nManuscripts with review of sensitivities by industry and receptors (species, habitats, human uses)\n\n\nMarineSensitivity.github.io\ndefault website\n\n\nmsens\nR library of functions for mapping marine sensitivities, sponsored by BOEM\n\n\nobjectives\nrepository for issues spanning multiple repositories and doing big picture roadmapping\n\n\nserver\nserver setup for R Shiny apps, RStudio IDE, R Plumber API, PostGIS database, pg_tileserv\n\n\nworkflows\nscripts for testing data analytics and visualization as well as production workflows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.0.4 Software Components\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPIs\n\n\napplication programming interfaces (APIs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApps\n\n\ninteractive applications using Shiny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase\n\n\nPostgreSQL database extended spatially with PostGIS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocs\n\n\ntechnical documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibraries\n\n\ndocumented functions as an R package\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer\n\n\nserver software configuration using Docker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkflows\n\n\nscripts for exploring plus production workflows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChang, Winston, Joe Cheng, JJ Allaire, Carson Sievert, Barret Schloerke, Yihui Xie, Jeff Allen, Jonathan McPherson, Alan Dipert, and Barbara Borges. 2024. “Shiny: Web Application Framework for r.” https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny.\n\n\nLowndes, Julia S.

Acclimatisation has been used to describe phenotypically plastic responses in natural conditions. Source: Ross et al. (2023).\n\nadaptation\n\nthe evolutionary mechanism where natural selection of traits is genetically passed on, typically over many generations, to create an organism suited to the environment. Source: [rossRoss et al. (2023)\n\nadaptive capacity\n\nthe capacity of the ecosystem or organism to improve and reorganise in response to stress such as climate change through phenotypic plasticity (acclimation, acclimatisation) or adaptation, distributional shifts, and rapid evolution of traits suited to new conditions. Source: Ross et al. (2023).\n\nepigenetics\n\nthe modification of phenotype plasticity of an organism through altered gene expression without an alteration to the DNA sequence. ‘Epi’ means above the DNA and includes DNA methylation, modification of histones, and non-coding RNA. Source: Ross et al. (2023).\n\nexposure\n\nthe magnitude of the change in the environment\n\nfecundity\n\nthe maximum physiological potential reproductive output of an organism to produce offspring (reproductive output). This differs from fertility, which is the number of offspring born.

Resilience reflects the degree to which a complex adaptive system is determined by its capacity to reorganise and adapt in order to avoid being disturbed again. Source: Ross et al.
