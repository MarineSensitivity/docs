# Apps

The MST provides two primary interactive web applications for exploring sensitivity data, plus several legacy applications from earlier development phases.

## Current Applications

### mapgl — Sensitivity Map

The [mapgl](https://shiny.marinesensitivity.org/mapgl/) application is the primary tool for exploring composite sensitivity scores across BOEM Program Areas. Key features include:

- **Multi-resolution viewing**: toggle between cell-level (0.05° grid) and program area aggregations
- **Study area selection**: focus on specific program areas or subregions
- **Layer selection**: view individual species category scores or composite metrics
- **Flower plot**: interactive summary showing scores by species category with weighted center value
- **Species table**: sortable table of species present in selected area with extinction risk details
- **Treemap**: hierarchical view of species contributions to sensitivity
- **CSV export**: download data for selected area or species

See [Appendix: mapgl](apps/mapgl.qmd) for details.

### mapsp — Species Distribution Viewer

The [mapsp](https://shiny.marinesensitivity.org/mapsp/) application enables exploration of individual species distribution models. Key features include:

- **Species selection**: search by common or scientific name, filter by species category
- **Model display**: view merged models or individual source dataset layers
- **IUCN masking toggle**: compare masked vs. unmasked distributions
- **Species info panel**: ESA listing, IUCN Red List category, MMPA/MBTA protection flags, extinction risk score
- **Deep-linking**: URL parameters support direct links to specific species

See [Appendix: mapsp](apps/mapsp.qmd) for details.

## Legacy Applications

Earlier versions of the MST included several prototype applications developed during the research phase. These are documented in the Appendix under [Applications (Legacy)](apps/aoi.qmd) for reference.
