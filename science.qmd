# need this chunk to use inline (`r ...`) glossary terms for non-html output with `g()` defined in libs/functions.R
```

## Conceptual Framework

The term `r g("vulnerability")` {{< glossary vulnerability >}} ($V$) is a function of `r g("exposure")` {{< glossary exposure >}} ($E$), `r g("sensitivity")` {{< glossary sensitivity >}} ($S$) and `r g("adaptive capacity")` {{< glossary "adaptive capacity" >}} ($A$) (@eq-v).

$$
V = f(E, S, A)
$$ {#eq-v}

The MST currently focuses on the **sensitivity** component, quantifying the intrinsic biological sensitivity of marine ecosystems based on the species present and their conservation status. Exposure and adaptive capacity components are planned for future phases (see @sec-stressors).

## Cell Vulnerability

For a given cell $c$, the vulnerability score for a species group $g$ is the sum across all $S_g$ species of the product of species presence probability $p_{sc}$ and extinction risk weight $w_s$ (@eq-cells-v):

$$
v_c = \sum_{s=1}^{S_g} p_{sc} \cdot w_s
$$ {#eq-cells-v}

where:

- $v_c$ = vulnerability score of cell $c$ for species group $g$
- $p_{sc}$ = probability of species $s$ presence in cell $c$ (0--1 scale, from merged species distribution models)
- $w_s$ = extinction risk weight for species $s$ (0--1 scale, derived from ESA/MMPA/MBTA/IUCN status; see @sec-extinction-risk)
- $S_g$ = total number of species in taxonomic group $g$ (e.g., bird, fish, mammal, coral, invertebrate, reptile/turtle)

## Sensitivity Components

The MST assesses sensitivity through three components:

1. **Species** — by taxonomic category (bird, coral, fish, invertebrate, mammal, reptile/turtle): extinction risk weighted species distribution models across 9,819 valid species (see @sec-data-sources, @sec-extinction-risk)
2. **Habitats** — benthic habitats such as coral reefs, seamounts, and hydrothermal vents (planned for future phases)
3. **Primary Productivity** — satellite-derived net primary productivity from the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM), measured as metric tons C km^-2^ yr^-1^ (see @sec-data-sources)

## Ecoregional Rescaling

Raw cell scores vary naturally across regions due to differences in species richness and oceanographic conditions. To enable meaningful cross-region comparison, scores are rescaled to a [0--100%] range within each BOEM ecoregion (@eq-rescale):

$$
v'_c = \frac{v_c - v_{min}}{v_{max} - v_{min}} \times 100
$$ {#eq-rescale}

where $v_{min}$ and $v_{max}$ are the minimum and maximum cell scores within the ecoregion. This accounts for the natural gradient from species-rich tropical waters to less diverse polar regions, ensuring that a "high sensitivity" score has consistent meaning across all program areas.
